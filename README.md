## [PROJECT] Changes on the lexical specification for "single character"

Hello, students.

The lexical specification for a single character is too ambiguous.

So, please implement your lexical analyzer by using the following modified specification for the token:

 

Single character 

A single digit, English letter, or blank, starting from and terminating with a symbol ‘ (e.g., ‘a’, ‘1’, ‘ ‘)

(This token does not include symbols anymore)
